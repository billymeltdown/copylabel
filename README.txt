HoldEm - README.txt
Billy Gray - January 21, 2010

This project is a POC iphone app for figuring out how to fire events while holding a UIView down.

Furthermore, it helped me work out a reference implementation for providing the copy menu for a UILabel subclass (or really any UIView subclass), and copy the label's text to the pasteboard.

So, hold down the Governator to make a button appear, and hold down on the label at the bottom to get the copy menu and to copy the text.
